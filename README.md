# Propeller Repairs
This simple script takes user input defining different aspects of boat propellers, using the information to create a repair work order.
The repair spec can then be used to generate a PO for the work.

## Propeller Aspects
* wcp_lh and wcp_rh: 'wcp' denotes a given propeller's serial number. This should be unique for historical tracking purposes.
* diameter: Propeller's overall diameter
* pitch: Propeller's desired pitch
* bore: Propeller's bore size (I.D.)
* hub: Propeller's hub length
* num_blades: Propeller's number of blades/flukes.
